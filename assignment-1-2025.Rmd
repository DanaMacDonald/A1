Instructions

For assignment 1, complete the following tasks

* Add your name and today's date up at the top of this file * Install the `palmerpenguins` package, unless you've already installed it, by clicking the yellow message at the top of the editing window, or using the Tools > Install packages... menu
* Familiarize yourself with the `penguins` dataset in the next section.
* Draw a plot and refine it twice using the methods from Lesson 5 Making your first plot as directed below
* Before knitting this file, make sure for each figure to:
-describe the figure you plan to show, 
-show your R code for the figure
-show the output of your R code
-say a sentence or 2 about each figure (interpretation)

## Look at the data

Here is a condensed overview of the `penguins` data

```{r}
str(penguins)
```
and an overview of the `penguins_raw` supplementary data.

```{r}
str(penguins_raw)
```

We will use the penguins dataset.

## New visualization

### Step 1 (3 pts)

<!--

q1.1

Write a R code (1 line) that print the names of the columns of the penguins dataset. [0.5 pts]

-->


```{r}
names(penguins)
```


<!--

q1.2

Create a scatterplot of bill length (on the x axis) and bill depth (on the y axis).  Make the simplest plot you can, using just `ggplot`, `aes` and `geom_point`. [1.5 pts]

-->


Plotting bill length against bill depth

```{r}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm)) + geom_point()
```


<!--
q1.3

Write 1 sentence that describes what you see (or do not see)  in your plot [1 pt]
-->

There is no apparent correlation between the length and depth of the penguin's bills, though at least 2 distinct groups in the data can be seen.


### Step 2 (2 pts)

<!--
q2.1

Refine your previous plot, adding colour or shape to indicate the species. Just do the minimal change. (2 pts)
-->

Plot of penguin bill length and depth, categorized by species using colour

```{r}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm)) +
  geom_point(aes(colour = species))
```


<!--

q2.2

-->

The addition of colour shows that the bill differs greatly by species, with little to no overlap in depth or length; the visualization shows each species as a distinct group.



### Step 3 (2 pts)

<!--

q3.1

Refine your plot by adding informative and readable axis labels and a brief title for the plot.
-->

Adding information to the above plot
```{r}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm)) +
  geom_point(aes(colour = species)) +
  labs(title = "Bill Depth vs Length in Penguin Species",
       x = "Bill Length (mm)",
       y = "Bill Depth (mm)")
```

The addition of proper labels improves readability and aesthetics of the plot.

## Another comparison 

<!--

q4 (2 pts)

Make any additional plot of your choice to illustrate another aspect of the comparison of penguins morphologies across species 
-->

I will use a coloured box and whisker plots to compare body mass to island for each  of the given penguin species.
```{r}
ggplot(penguins, aes(island, body_mass_g)) + 
  geom_boxplot(aes(colour = species)) +
  labs(title = "Penguin Body Mass Across Islands",
       x = "Island", 
       y = "Body mass (g)")
```
It is clear that the Gentoo species has a higher body mass on average than the other species - likely not caused by environment, as the Adelie species is found on each island, with very slight variation. 

<!--

q5 Knit and submit Rmd+pdf (1 pt)

Knit your work to pdf (click "knit" in the menu just at the top of the editing window).

If knitting does not work, spot the line with an error, fix the error in your Rmd file, then reknit. Iterate this procedure until until there are no errors and knitting finishes.

If knitting to pdf does not work, knit to html, load the html in your web browser and use the print function of your browser to print your html file 'as pdf'.

Once done, upload two files, (one after the other): your Rmd file and the knitted pdf.

DO NOT FORGET TO REPLACE your name and banner id in the header of this file, but do NOT mess up the header!

Pushing your report to github [Unmarked but do it!]

Stage, commit and push your final .Rmd and your .html file to your GitHub repository (as done in W2 task number 3- see instructions on Brightspace>Week 2).
